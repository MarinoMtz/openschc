## Simulator

A simulator and a set of classes are available for OpenSCHC.
They are in the files `src/net_sim_*`, and `src/net_sim_builder.py` provides a nicer upper-level API  to use them.

An short simple example is provided how to use it:
 * The code for the simulation (one device, one gateway) `test_simul.py`, 
 * A script that sets the proper `PYTHONPATH` (to add `../src`) and run `test_simul_py` is `run_test_simul.sh`

 How to run it: `./run_test_simul.sh`
